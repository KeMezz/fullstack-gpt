       "AIMessage(content='For a vegetarian version of Bibimbap, you can make a few simple swaps to replace the meat in the recipe:\\n\\n1. **Replace the beef**: Instead of using beef, you can substitute it with tofu or tempeh. Both tofu and tempeh are great sources of plant-based protein and can absorb flavors well when marinated. Cut the tofu or tempeh into thin slices and marinate them in a mixture of soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, salt, and pepper, similar to how you would marinate the beef. Let it sit for at least 30 minutes to absorb the flavors before cooking.\\n\\n2. **Cooking the tofu or tempeh**: You can cook the marinated tofu or tempeh in a pan until browned and slightly crispy. This will give it a nice texture and flavor that will work well in the Bibimbap.\\n\\nBy making these simple swaps, you can enjoy a delicious vegetarian version of Bibimbap that is just as flavorful and satisfying as the original recipe.')"
